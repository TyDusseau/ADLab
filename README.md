# Active Directory Home Lab

## Objective

In this Active Directory lab project, I aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of key concepts by building an Active Directory infrastructure, implementing Splunk as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, and executing simulated attacks using Kali Linux. Through hands-on experience, I sought to master the intricacies of AD architecture, user management, and group policies while leveraging Splunk to analyze and respond to security events effectively. Additionally, by orchestrating attacks on a Windows host device via Kali Linux, I aimed to gain insights into common attack vectors and develop robust defensive strategies to fortify network defenses. Ultimately, the objective was to enhance my skills in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices within a controlled environment.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in building and configuring Active Directory infrastructure.
- Advanced knowledge of Active Directory architecture, including domain controllers, forests, and trusts.
- Experience in analyzing security events and responding to incidents within a SIEM environment.
- Ability to troubleshoot common AD issues, including authentication failures, replication problems, and DNS-related issues.

### Tools Used

- Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC): Leveraged for advanced management tasks, including managing Active Directory domains, forests, trusts, and schema.
- Splunk Enterprise deployed as the core SIEM platform for ingesting, indexing, and analyzing log data from various sources, including Active Directory logs.
- Kali Linux crowbar tool to perform brute force attacks on Active Directory users.
- VirtualBox to create a network of virtual machines, allowing all attacks and defense to be done in a safe and controlled environment.
